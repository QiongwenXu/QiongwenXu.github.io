I am currently a Ph.D. student at Rutgers University, under the supervision of Prof. [**Srinivas Narayana**](<https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn624/>). My research insterests are Computer Networks and Algorithm Engineering. I focus on designing an optimizing compiler for BPF recently. Previously, I was with Self-Organizing Network and Information Coding Lab (SONIC) at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [**Xin Wang**](<http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/xinw2013/home/>) and Prof. [**Jin Zhao**](<http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/jzhao/en/>) from 2015 to 2018.
